I was responsible for making the keyboard and managing CoreData as well as making the demo site for it. This is another iOS application that is an on going project for me. Any time I think of a new feature I add it as quickly as I can to keep the app fresh in the app store. I just recently updated the app to support the new version of swift. It has been a blast to work on and you should try it out if you get a chance.'

I will try to actually keep this program updated. It is a really simple javascript program that uses jQuery to select all of the elements on the page with the tweet-promoted tag and removes them when the actual page loads. I am going to try to keep my github more up to date with what I am doing so if you would like to check out the source code you should check out the repository for it.'

One of the videos I produced was viewed over 2,000 times and featured on googleâ€™s facebook page. They were a lot of fun to work with and I hope to work with them again in the future.'

I also make sure to support all the fancy new features apple comes out with so the app stays fresh.'
